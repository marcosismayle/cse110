# 13 Prepare: Checkpoint

## Overview

This checkpoint is designed to help you practice writing basic functions.

## Assignment

Write three functions:

- **display_regular**—Receives a string and prints it out, exactly as received.

- **display_uppercase**—Receives a string, converts it to upper case, and then prints it out.

- **display_lowercase**—Receives a string, converts it to lower case, and then prints it out.

In your program below the functions, ask the user to type a message. Then, pass that message to each of the three functions, so it it displays it each way, as shown:

    What is your message? Brother Burton
    Brother Burton
    BROTHER BURTON
    brother burton

Another example is:

    What is your message? The only thing we have to fear is FEAR itself!
    The only thing we have to fear is FEAR itself!
    THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF!
    the only thing we have to fear is fear itself!
